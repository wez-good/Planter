# Planter
Smart planter

# Current State (V1): 
Mechanical Design & 3D Fabrication. Focused on water management, drainage systems, and structural integrity.

# Future Roadmap (V2 - The "Living Plant" Update):
Logic: Integrating an Arduino/ESP32 to monitor soil moisture levels.

HMI (Human-Machine Interface): Implementing an OLED/LED screen to display real-time "emotional" feedback based on sensor data.

IoT Connectivity: Potential for Wi-Fi alerts when the plant needs water.
